- Fix perf. issues in TASSr6 by disabling coded arithmetics for short series
- Fix unnecessarily long series in binomial expansion for pow (maybe fixed with exponentiation by squaring?)
- Use reference counted pointer to psymbols to make them live only as necessary?
- Unify stream_manager and settings?
- Move meta-programming in base_series_* into own headers to improve readability.
- Poisson and poly multiplier: truncator calls also when inserting terms for generality,
  and check for canonical form before final insertion to perform in-line adjustments
  without the need to copy terms during base_series insertion later.
- GMP limb: " A limb means the part of a multi-precision number that fits in a single word.
  Normally a limb contains 32 or 64 bits. The C data type for a limb is mp_limb_t.". Use this
  to evaluate the real size of GMP variables when we will do cache-blocking during multiplications.

- Add line - file info into exceptions string.
- Coded multiplication with mpz as codes when going out of range?
- elements_* --> ints_* in int_array for clarity
- int_array --> key_int_array for clarity
- add truncators to polynomials, if they do not impact performance too much.
- implement truncation by degree in expo truncator.
- enable besselJ for polynomials that are single coefficients without bothering about expo limits.
- there _is_ a mpz_swap function, check if it is useful.
- understand the relation between ordering and vector coded performance. For polynomials it increases performance
  a total degree lex order, for poisson series it _seems_ no.
- use effectively a null_truncator in place of the chosen truncator if this is not effective (i.e., it can be
  established without doubt that the truncator will _not_ truncate anything). This is doubly useful:
  1) use null truncator for maximum speed when suitable
  2) avoid sorting if the truncator won't truncate.
- find a method to establish how to cache a coefficient vector during multiplication if appropriate.
- optimize for small series --> there's no need to avoid direct insertion in series, since we do
  not have sorte indices anymore. For small series, also avoid all the re-sorting and possible coefficient
  copies that are performed for longer series.
