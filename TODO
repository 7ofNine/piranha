- Fix perf. issues in TASSr6 by disabling coded arithmetics for short series
- Fix unnecessarily long series in binomail expansion for pow.
- Use reference counted pointer to psymbols to make them live only as necessary?
- Unify stream_manager and settings?
- Move meta-programming in base_series_* into own headers to improve readability.
- Poisson and poly multiplier: truncator calls also when inserting terms for generality,
  and check for canonical form before final insertion to perform in-line adjustments
  without the need to copy terms during base_series insertion later.
- GMP limb: " A limb means the part of a multi-precision number that fits in a single word.
  Normally a limb contains 32 or 64 bits. The C data type for a limb is mp_limb_t.". Use this
  to evaluate the real size of GMP variables when we will do cache-blocking during multiplications.
