FreeBSD:
=======

Tested on version 6.2. The Boost libraries from package collection are ok,
even if they print a warning message during compilation that seems quite
unharmful.

Pyranha works too, provided that boost_python is installed (it is in a separate
package) and provided that you do _not_ have Python 2.5 installed, since boost_python
has been compiled against Python 2.4 and CMake picks up the latest Python version
available.

GMP libraries can be installed from packages and used in piranha. Haven't tried
pyranha's GUI yet. PyQt4 version >= 4.2 are is most likely the minimum requirement.
