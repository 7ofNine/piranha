The files in these directories are the solutions of the ELP2000 lunar theory
by Chapront-Touze' and Chapront, and of the TASS17 theory for the motions of
Saturn's satellites, by Vienne and Duriez.

The files were obtained from the ftp server of the imcce,

	ftp://ftp.imcce.fr

and are adapted for the Piranha format. The files are freely downloadable.
